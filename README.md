# phase-1-project

This application will allow users to see and filter cocktail recipes based on ingredients they already have on hand. 

As I user, I want to load a base page that shows random recipes. 

From there, I want to be able to click a dropdrown to select an ingredient I have on hand to show drink recipes I can make with that.

The drink recipes should be shown in individual cards.
